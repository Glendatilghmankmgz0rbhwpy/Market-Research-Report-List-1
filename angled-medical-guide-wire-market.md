<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Angled Medical Guide Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Guide Wire</li><li>Hydrophobic Guide Wire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Angled medical guide wires are used in medical procedures to navigate through blood vessels and other parts of the body. There are two main types of guide wires: hydrophilic guide wires, which are coated with a special material that attracts water and helps the wire glide smoothly through the body, and hydrophobic guide wires, which repel water and are used in situations where a dry surface is preferred. Both types of guide wires are important tools in medical procedures requiring precise and controlled navigation through the body.</p></p>
