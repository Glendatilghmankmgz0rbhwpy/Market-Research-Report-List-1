<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chitin Synthesis Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BPUs</li><li>NucleosidePeptideAntibiotics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chitin Synthesis Inhibitors (CSIs) are a type of insecticide that disrupts the formation of chitin, a key component of insect exoskeletons. There are two main types of CSIs in the market: BPUs (benzoylphenyl ureas) and NucleosidePeptideAntibiotics. BPUs work by inhibiting chitin synthesis in insects, leading to their death. NucleosidePeptideAntibiotics, on the other hand, target the enzymes involved in chitin synthesis. Both types of CSIs are widely used in agriculture to control insect pests and protect crops.</p></p>
