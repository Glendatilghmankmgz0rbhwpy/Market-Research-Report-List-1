<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrical Galvanized Steel Tubes</li><li>Hot-dip Galvanized Steel Tubes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized steel tubes are classified into two main types: Electrical Galvanized Steel Tubes and Hot-dip Galvanized Steel Tubes. Electrical galvanized steel tubes are coated with a thin layer of zinc using an electrochemical process, making them suitable for indoor applications where corrosion resistance is a priority. On the other hand, hot-dip galvanized steel tubes are immersed in a bath of molten zinc, creating a thicker and more durable zinc coating. This makes them ideal for outdoor applications where protection against harsh environmental conditions is essential.</p></p>
