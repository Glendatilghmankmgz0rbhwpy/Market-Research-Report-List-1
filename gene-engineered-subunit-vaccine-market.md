<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Engineered Subunit Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Therapeutic Gene Engineered Subunit Vaccine</li><li>Preventative Gene Engineered Subunit Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Therapeutic Gene Engineered Subunit Vaccines are designed to treat existing diseases by targeting specific proteins or antigens associated with the disease. They work by stimulating an immune response to eliminate infected cells or inhibit the growth of pathogens. Preventative Gene Engineered Subunit Vaccines, on the other hand, are intended to prevent diseases by priming the immune system to recognize and fight off potential infections before they occur. Both types of vaccines offer targeted and effective means of combating various diseases.</p></p>
