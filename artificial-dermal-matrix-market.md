<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Dermal Matrix Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>From Animal Source</li><li>From Human Source</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial dermal matrix from animal source involves using collagen derived from animals, such as pigs or cows, to create a scaffold for skin regeneration. This type of matrix is biocompatible and can promote tissue growth and wound healing in humans. On the other hand, artificial dermal matrix from human source uses human-derived collagen, which may offer better compatibility and integration with the patient's own tissue. Both types of matrices are utilized in various medical procedures, such as skin grafting and wound treatment.</p></p>
