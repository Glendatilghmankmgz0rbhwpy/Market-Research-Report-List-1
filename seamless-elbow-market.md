<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seamless Elbow Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Rolled Seamless Elbow</li><li>Cold Drawn Seamless Elbow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hot rolled seamless elbows are manufactured by heating a round steel billet and then shaping it into the desired elbow shape through a series of rollers. This process results in a seamless and strong elbow suitable for high-pressure applications. On the other hand, cold drawn seamless elbows are manufactured by pulling a steel billet through a die to achieve the desired shape without heating the material. This process produces a smoother surface finish and tighter dimensional tolerances compared to hot rolled elbows.</p></p>
