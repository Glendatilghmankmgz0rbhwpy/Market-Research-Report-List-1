<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compression Dressing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Cooler</li><li>Without Cooler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compression dressing systems with cooler are advanced medical devices that provide both compression and cooling therapy for managing post-operative swelling and pain. These systems generally consist of a compression pump that delivers intermittent compression along with a cooling unit that circulates cold water through pads worn on the affected body part.</p><p>On the other hand, compression dressing systems without cooler are simpler devices that provide compression therapy without the additional cooling function. These systems are more basic in design but still effective in reducing swelling and promoting healing.</p></p>
