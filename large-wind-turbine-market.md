<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Wind Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical-Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The large wind turbine market can be classified into two main types: Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). HAWTs have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, capturing wind from any direction. VAWTs have blades that rotate around a vertical axis, allowing them to capture wind from any direction without the need for a yaw mechanism. Both types of turbines have their own advantages and disadvantages, depending on factors such as wind conditions and space availability.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Large Wind Turbine Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Offshore</li><li>Onshore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Large wind turbines are used in both offshore and onshore applications to generate renewable energy. Offshore wind turbines are located in bodies of water, typically in deeper waters where the wind is stronger and more consistent. These turbines are larger and more powerful than their onshore counterparts, making them ideal for harnessing energy in marine environments. Onshore wind turbines, on the other hand, are located on land and are more commonly used for producing electricity for local communities and larger power grids.</p></p>
