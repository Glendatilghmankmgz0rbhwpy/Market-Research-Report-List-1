<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Preset Resistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Turn</li><li>Multi Turn</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Preset resistors are commonly categorized into two types based on their design: single turn and multi turn. Single turn preset resistors have a single rotational adjustment, allowing for quick and easy changes to the resistance value. On the other hand, multi turn preset resistors offer more precise adjustments with multiple rotations to dial in the resistance value more accurately. Both types cater to different applications and requirements based on the level of precision needed in a circuit.</p></p>
