<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermocouple Temperature Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Thermocouple Temperature Sensor</li><li>Non-contact Thermocouple Temperature Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermocouple Temperature Sensors are classified into two types: Contact Thermocouple Temperature Sensors and Non-contact Thermocouple Temperature Sensors. Contact thermocouples require physical contact with the object whose temperature is being measured, while non-contact thermocouples can measure temperature from a distance without touching the object. Contact thermocouples are typically used for direct temperature measurements in industrial processes, while non-contact thermocouples are used in situations where physical contact is not possible or practical, such as measuring the temperature of moving objects or hazardous materials.</p></p>
