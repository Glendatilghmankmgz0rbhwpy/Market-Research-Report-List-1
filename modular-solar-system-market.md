<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Solar System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tie Solar</li><li>Off-Grid Solar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grid-tie solar systems are connected to the local utility grid and allow users to generate their own electricity while also utilizing grid power when needed. This type of system is ideal for homeowners looking to reduce energy bills and potentially sell excess power back to the grid. Off-grid solar systems, on the other hand, operate independently of the grid and are commonly used in remote locations or where grid power is unreliable or unavailable. These systems typically rely on batteries for energy storage.</p></p>
