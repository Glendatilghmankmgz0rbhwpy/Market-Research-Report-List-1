<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Conversion Type</li><li>No-Thermal Conversion Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nuclear batteries can be classified into two main types based on their conversion process: thermal conversion type and no-thermal conversion type. Thermal conversion type nuclear batteries use the heat generated from radioactive decay to produce electricity, while no-thermal conversion type batteries directly convert the radiation emitted by the radioactive material into electrical energy without the need for a heat conversion process. Both types of nuclear batteries are used for various applications where long-lasting and reliable power sources are required.</p></p>
