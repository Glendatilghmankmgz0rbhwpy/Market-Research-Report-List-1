<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seawater Cooling Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Seawater Cooling Pump market consists of two main types - centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps work by converting rotational energy from a motor into kinetic energy in the liquid being pumped, creating a flow. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, use a mechanism to physically displace the fluid, pushing it through the system. Both types are commonly used in seawater cooling systems for industries such as power generation, desalination plants, and marine applications.</p></p>
