<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Temperature Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Processing</li><li>Out-Of-Autoclave Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-temperature prepreg market can be divided into two types of processing methods: autoclave processing and out-of-autoclave processing. Autoclave processing involves curing the prepreg in an autoclave, which is a high-pressure and high-temperature chamber. This method ensures excellent consolidation and high-quality finished parts, but it is expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, out-of-autoclave processing involves curing the prepreg using alternative methods such as vacuum bagging and oven curing. This process is more cost-effective and quicker, but it may not provide the same level of consolidation and quality as autoclave processing.</p></p>
