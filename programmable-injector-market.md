<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Programmable Injector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split</li><li>Splitless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Programmable injectors are used in gas chromatography to introduce samples into the system. Two common types are split and splitless injectors. </p><p>In a split injector, only a portion of the sample is introduced into the chromatograph, while the rest is diverted away. This allows for better detection of lower concentration samples. </p><p>In a splitless injector, the entire sample is introduced into the system, making it ideal for trace analysis or samples with very low concentrations. Both types offer advantages depending on the specific requirements of the analysis being conducted.</p></p>
