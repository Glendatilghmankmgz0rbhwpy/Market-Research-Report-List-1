<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Refrigeration Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Programmable</li><li>Not Programmable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital refrigeration gauges come in two main types: programmable and non-programmable. Programmable gauges allow users to set specific parameters, such as temperature and pressure thresholds, to meet their unique needs. This customization makes them ideal for more complex refrigeration systems. On the other hand, non-programmable gauges are pre-set with standard settings and are more suitable for simpler refrigeration systems where customization is not necessary. Both types offer accurate real-time data to ensure efficient and reliable refrigeration operations.</p></p>
